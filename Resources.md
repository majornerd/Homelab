Homelab Resources.

I have combined the resources I found interesting from /homelab, /datahorder, /homeserver and /selfhosted as well as anywhere else that had tools of interest.

My goal is to build an enterprise class network in my basement, with all the tools I find useful or interesting as well as the data tools that I am either using on a daily basis, or those I am experimenting with.  BigData is my current obsession, while my day job is managment I will always be an engineer/architect at heart.

I will try to keep track of the things I learn here and share them with the community.

One thing to note, I have no attachment to free software.  While I prefer well executed and well maintained OSS tools, I am also not tied to them.  If I was building an Enterprise network some things would need to be paid for.

That being said, there are also tons of things that can be done to manage licensing costs at home, and as I find them I will be happy to share any of the tricks I have learned along the way.
